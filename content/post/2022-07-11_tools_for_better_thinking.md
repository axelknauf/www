It is not a secret that I am fond of mental models and worried about the state of rationality of mankind. That's why I was happy to find this collection of tools and frameworks that help structure thinking:

Who thinks this is too high-level may find the workshop formats of Liberating Structures a good alternative:

Maybe there's something for you in there? Happy thinking!
