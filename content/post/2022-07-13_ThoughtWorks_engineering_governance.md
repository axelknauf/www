[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) is well-known for their Tech Radar and general impact on the IT software development community. They just recently released an article about "Engineering productivity governance and improvement in software delivery". The title may be a bit unwieldy, but the content is interesting and relevant for everybody working with software engineering teams.

It's about how to make teams more successful, individuals happier and customers more satisfied by implementing a variety of processes and methods in order to structure the ways of working. Best practices from the XP and agile communities as well as feedback and core values are also part of the mix.

What I liked about the article is how they aim for improving the four key metrics from the [book "Accelerate"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerate_(book)). These metrics are indicators of a company's success in the digital market.

I believe the article is relevant for everybody working in IT, not only software developers or project managers.
