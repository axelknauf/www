# AI and creative work

After the appearance of all those AI tools that allow generating images from
prompts, the next obvious question is how they integrate into the creative
workflow for visual artists. Will those artists be replaced by AI? How does
their work change? In which form?

This post shows nicely the possibilities how to start with a simple
line-drawing and the use [stable
diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) from an AI model
(composed of about 4.2G of weights) in order to produce great images. Some
manual fine tuning using Gimp or Photoshop may still be required:

If you want to try it yourself you can find the model and instructions at Github:
